## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: I forgot to follow the mobile-first approach and created the project based on the desktop design first.**

### What I learned

In this project, I strengthened my command over CSS Grid, understood Flexbox, and clarified my concepts of media queries. I learned how to use margin and padding effectively to design my project beautifully.
